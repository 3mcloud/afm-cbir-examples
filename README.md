This repository contains example data and code demonstrating how to reproduce the data pre-processing and model building procedures defined in the above paper. All code need for loading, reading, and performing model inference on AFM topographies is provided in this repository. Any questions can be referred to Marcus Schwarting (meschw04@uchicago.edu).
